# Normalized comparison of GCSE results for boys and girls for 2011 and 2012

A short Python project for analysing GCSE data. 
Data was saved into Numpy arrays. And stacked bar plots were generated from the normalized data. Bokeh library was used to generate HTML plots.
I have used this project as an opprotunity to start learning Numpy and Bokeh libraries.

## Installation

Written in Python 2.7. 

Modules and Packages:

* Bokeh
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Math
* Matplotlib
* Textwrap

## Usage

Run the script from terminal, e.g.

```bash
python text_analyser.py -d test_docs/ -o 5 -l 6
python text_analyser.py -f test_docs/doc3.txt -s 2
```

## Future ideas

* Improve Bokeh plots - loop
